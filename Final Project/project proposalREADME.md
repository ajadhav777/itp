#FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL

Build a display window by choosing options provided (like a background) and get music according to the vibe/photo. 

The music will be played through Spotify, so the code will have Spotify connected to it. 

There are limited options, and the majority of the chosen options will lead to a genre which will lead to a song.

Q: Can I choose a random song from the genre-specific playlist?
-> because if we have multiple options for each specific thing, we will have to note ALL possible combinations and have songs for each of them instead of just choosing one for the majority.

What would the specifics be?

- Weather: sun, rain, snow
- Day or night
- Color of the sky: Blue, Dark Blue, Purple, Red
(can I add a colour spectrum so I can choose any colour? and then we choose a genre based on cool or warm colours or something like that)
- Flower options: Roses, jasmine, hydrangea, chrysanthemum
- Possible genres: Pop, Rock, RnB, Jazz, Hip hop


**CHALLENGES**

1) I would have to connect Spotify to the code
2) I would have to make playlists for each genre (not too bad of a challenge)
3) I would have to mention how the majority works, i.e. sun, day, blue, hydrangea = jazz, and if 2 out of them are chosen, the result will always be a jazz song. 
4) If Spotify does not connect, how do I add playlists to the code for the project to select from?
