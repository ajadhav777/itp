So I started with stating my aim in chatgpt, as I did not know how to go about beginning the code. Chatgpt gave me a pretty solid code, obviously the layout was different to what I had in mind. I went to change things.

I also got the code for my flowers from chat. Initially it was just a circle on a stem, but I wanted different types of flowers, not different colored flowers. 

I have to fix my background color code, because as of now the code has a color picker options, which allows for many shades of every color. While this is cool, I cannot make my song decision with so many color options. Maybe I can keep it in? But for now, I want to change it to keep it to 3-4 options. 

I'm trying to figure out how to tweak the code. Right now I have added a 'colorPicker.option' code, but I realised these codes aren't linked to the actual color code (hex codes as well) so now I'm going to go ahead and add them in and link them. 

I wanted to make the moon a crescent shape instead of an ellipse, so I'm figuring that out.
Realised that it kinda needs a long code, and I'm not too bothered by the shape of the moon so I'll let it be.

Started working on the logic part of it - to play songs according to the options the user has selected. I thought long and hard and after messing around with it I realised that there are way too many combinations to be typed, so I narrowed it down to certain seasons and flowers only, and some have time of day option too. The rest of it is just for fun, because customization is cool. 

The song would not play after options were chosen which was so annoying. I also realised I cannot link spotify to it, it has way too many limitations, so I ended up putting in mp3 files in p5.js. 

Also found out that it won't play because there has to be a button to call it. Added that with the help of chat. 

I basically voice memo'd all the songs I wanted and put them into p5. 

They play!!!
This is so cool and I like how it turned out :)
