Started with using "// âœ… Finding numbers divisible by 7 and 5 between 1500 and 2700
for (let i = 1500; i <= 2700; i++) {
  if (i % 7 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log(i);" as a reference to begin my code.
	
	Ran into a couple of code running issues as I forgot to put in a semicolon or a bracket here and there
	Finally got the code to print numbers divisible by 3 & 5 - realised that it only prints if the number is divisible by BOTH 3 & 5.
	Made it print numbers only divisible by 3.
> 	Realised that if I say "for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  }"
  it will print only numbers divisible by 3. Need to figure out how to make it print all numbers
  
  I wrote a code but when I tried to run it, it said "parser error"
  This is very frustrating ...
  
  I chat gpt'ed the question (not sure if I'm allowed to)
  It gave me the response
  I read it and I'm going to try and write the whole thing by myself without referring to it
  
  I wrote the whole code by myself
  There were some errors - it said I cannot state 'i' twice and i had a random bracket or something
  
  i fixed it
  
  I DID IT IT WORKED i could not be happier, honestly
  :)
  
  
  i tried to re-do it for the fun of it, and for some reason the code i wrote would not work at all:

  //for (let i = 1; 1 <= 100; i++) {
  //	if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
  //		console.log("FizzBuzz");
  //	}
  //	else if (i % 3 === 0) {
  //		console.log("Fizz");
  //		
  //	}
  //	else if (i % 5 === 0) {
  //		console.log("Buzz");
  //	}
  //	else {
  //		console.log(i);
  //	}
  	//}
	
	but the first one i did works just fine. is it a formatting issue?
