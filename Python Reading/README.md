#Python Reading


CHAPTER 1

1 thing I knew: I knew there were 2 types of values - integer and floating point number. 

1 thing I did not know: The concept of Parsing. I did run into errors regarding this issue previously but never knew why it happened and how to fix it.

CHAPTER 3 

1 thing I knew: I was aware of the flow of execution. It is important to order the statements in the right way so they run efficiently. 

1 thing I did not know: I was not aware of the stack diagram concept. It seems like a better way to have a note of things through graphical representation. 

CHAPTER 5

1 thing I knew: Boolean expressions. Expressions are either True or false. 

1 thing I did not know: Stack diagrams for recursive functions. I did not know we draw them out so we can visualise it better, which is a nice thing to do!

CHAPTER 10

1 thing I knew: I knew that a list is a sequence of values, that can be of any type. 

1 thing I did not know: Aliasing. I did not know we could add multiple references to one object.
