#band project - by Tiril, Lorenzo & Anushka

we began the project by deciding on a band name. we landed on 'scream' and got a description of our band through chatgpt.

we wanted to add in a spotify song, so we got the code/link online 

we added in solo descriptions for each band member, again through chatgpt. 

we added in paragraphs, header1, header3, bold text, image. 

we started a css code and added in our background image which was made in photoshop. 

we changed the color of the text and the font of the text. the fonts are limited :\

the background wasnt fitting to the display size (we later found out that it has to adapt to each display space so we have to fix that i guess)

that was pretty much it!
