i am trying to recall what the process is for saving the aiff file in documents by looking at the github steps on canvas

i found the important commands and i am recording the aiff file now

i saved the voice recording and then put it into 261sp25 and then my haiku subfolder.

(this was so fun i actually enjoyed doing that)

ok now i realised i've to upload the link, so i am figuring that out

i changed my username because it was unprofessional i guess. 

i then uploaded my link to canvas and hopefully i got it right.

done !!
